# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 13, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Built a HTML version of @unicodevelper's Laravel exam and deployeed it to Github pages. Finally getting comfortable with Javascript after years of running away from it.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getting the upvote and downvote functionality to work but unfortunately I was unable to find a fix. Had to pause it to watch a few JS30 videos and complete a client's design work.

**Link to work:** [Laravel Exam](https://ifeanyidavid.github.io/laravel-exam/)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
