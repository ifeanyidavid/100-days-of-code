# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a HTML version of @unicodevelper's Laravel exam and deployeed it to Github pages. Finally getting comfortable with Javascript after years of running away from it.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getting the upvote and downvote functionality to work but unfortunately I was unable to find a fix. Had to pause it to watch a few JS30 videos and complete a client's design work.

### Day 1: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today wasn't really productive because I had to work on a design project for a client. I worked on the Javascript error a bit more towards the end of the day and I learnt how event handling really works

**Thoughts:** I think with more consistent practice, I could finally be more comfortable with writing Javascript.
